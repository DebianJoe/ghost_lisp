Symbolic Builtins:
	
	;; VARIABLE FUNCTIONS
	\    = lambda
	def	 = define
	=    = builtin put
	
	;; LIST FUNCTIONS
	list = make list
	cons = construct list
	head = retrieve first item of list
	car  = same as head, traditional
	tail = retrieve all but first item from list
	cdr  = same as tail, traditional
	eval = evaluate expression
	join = join two or more lists together
	
	;; MATHMATICAL FUNCTIONS
	+    = add
	-    = subtract
	*    = multiply
	/    = divide
	%    = modulus
	
	;; COMPARISON FUNCTIONS
	if   = if compare
	==   = equality check
	!=   = inequality check
	>    = greater than
	<    = less than
	>=   = greater than or equal
	<=   = less than or equal
	
	;; STRING FUNCTIONS
	load  = load lisp script (load "/full/path/to/file")
	error = define new error
	print = print output to user
	
	;; SYSTEM FUNCTIONS
	spawn = execvp a child process (spawn "/bin/sh")
	exit  = cleanly exit program   (exit (foobar))

Notes on using Quoted Expressions (Qexpr)
      Quoted expressions are enclosed with {squiggly-braces} and are
      used to signify lists 
      > {items in a list}
      > {1 2 3 4 5}

      They are also used for delimiting variables and sections of
      functions.  The best examples of usage are in the stdlib.glsp
      file.

      > (def {define} (\ f l) {eval (join (list f) l)})
      > (def {nil} {})
      > (def {true} 1)

      Ghostlisp by its simplistic nature attempts to evaluate normally
      enclosed (parentheticals) earlier in the process.  So, rather than
      passing the enclosed function or list, it will simply evaluate it 
      as a symbolic expression and then complain that you passed a result:

      Error:  Function 'foobar' passed incorrect type for argument 1. 
      Got S-Expression, Expected Q-Expression.
